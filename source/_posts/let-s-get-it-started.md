This is the very first post for Get Noticed! challenge. I will try to point out for what reasons I have decided to take part in it. Where the project idea came from. And some more.

## 3, 2, 1 ...
... ready, get set, go! These words I have planned to write on March 1, when the main part of [Get Noticed!](http://devstyle.pl/daj-sie-poznac/) contest was about to start. Things didn't went that well. I guessed I have fallen into the *hardest first step* hole. Publishing this post I hope I will *release the kraken* ;) and I will be more productive in this matter.

## Why?

Firstly I would like to point some reasons why I started this challenge. The whole February I was struggling in my head whether I should make such commitment, or I should not. I love reading blog posts, listening to podcasts and/or watching what others creativity is able to do. Many times I have read/heard how beneficial blogging can be. How it helped to develop those who started. How it changed their lives, and so on. At one point I also wanted those benefits, but on the other, I have got some other ... priorities on which I could/should/want spend my time on.

What's more, I was never into writing. One of the worst periods of my life was when I had to write my diploma thesis ;) I used to write a lot with people over the Internet, but I guess it's slightly different. There is no questions I can reply. I have to think about the post structure, subheadings, subject consistency, and bunch of whatnots. It ain't easy ... at least for now :)

The decision about submitting the contest form has been made after a short talk of [Paweł Słomka](http://mycodesmells.com/) at [Boiling Frogs 2017](2017.boilingfrogs.pl) conference I attended. He talked about his challenge of 100 posts in a single year, and how that influenced himself. 100 posts a year is more less the same as the requirement of *Get Noticed!* rules, except, just for 10 weeks. Paweł has successfully completed his *daunting* commitment, so why shouldn't I. At least I will try.

## What?

Along with the *sign in or not* dilemma, I had to figure out what kind of a project I would like to develop. What kind of a problem I would like to solve with it? Who will use it? How will it work? Lot of unanswered questions. I could use websites like [ideaswatch.com](http://ideaswatch.com) or take one from [awesome-app-ideas @ github](https://github.com/tastejs/awesome-app-ideas), but I have decided for follow a different path.

I started asking: which one of my own problems I would like to solve? Is it my very own and unique, or some others as well? What group of people I am part of, that could have certain set of concerns? Or even, who could potential pay for a good solution? That's how I came up with this idea for an app called *EMA*. It's an abbreviation from *Eat Me Again* :)

Since quite a while one of my interests is nutrition. Among my colleagues I am known for being vegan, but I rather think about my diet as *plant-based*. Health is my highest priority so I struggle every day to eat as *green* and *unprocessed* food as I can. At the same time, I would like to provide my body with all essential nutrients. But it is not that easy in these fast-paced times, having ready-made meals at our fingertips. So I would like to gather information about what I ate. How often do I eat certain products. What should I focus on the next time I enter the kitchen. *EMA* could help me. Hopefully :)

Some might say that there are plenty of apps that could do something similar. Sure. Probably. But, my excessive demands cannot be satisfied just like that ;) Plus, I would like to implement my own and curated list of features. Nothing that could distract or annoy me each and every day. More details about the app itself I will present in future posts. I have to figure them out first :)

## For?

In the name of self-improvement. Mostly. Developing that project I plan to widen my knowledge in mobile development. Widen? I should write: get into any mobile development, because I am a total *newbie* in this subject. I have never did anything for mobile devices. I don't even own a smartphone ;)

The second reason related with this blog and self-improvement would be *English*. At certain point I had to decide which language I will use creating this blog. I am quite fluent in English when it comes to reading or listening, but I kinda suck in writing and speaking. The latter one for sure. Hopefully, after the contest, I will be still motivated to write posts and keep growing my writing skills.

Having said that, please, do not hesitate to leave a comment regarding anything that could help me to improve. It doesn't matter if I did a grammar mistake, I have implemented something wrong, I could write a piece of code shorter/nicer/more [performant(??)](http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/38945/what-is-wrong-with-the-word-performant), whatever. Any feedback is welcome. I am eager for it ... unless I cannot learn from it. So then, any *valuable* feed is welcome ;) Under this post as well as under future ones. Thanks in advance.

## Goals?

Well, previous chapters point out reasons why I have started the *EMA* project. Self-improvement is my goal, but it could be hard to measure if I have already reached it or not. After reading one of [JavaDevMatt's blog posts](http://www.javadevmatt.pl/projekt-do-daj-sie-poznac-cele-i-wstepny-plan/), I thought I could set something similar for my pet project too. One of his goals was to acknowledge more about making money on mobile games and earn 100 zloty making one. I have no clue how profitable are mobile games, nor nutrition apps, so I set the minimum income at th level of 1 zloty. Yeap, just one :) That should force me to focus on wider range of aspects of mobile development, not only the technology I will use, code I will wrote, etc. If this symbolic one zloty is impossible to gain, please, don't tell me that ;)

And thanks for reading :)
