    <p>This is the very first post for Get Noticed! challenge. I will try to point out for what reasons I have decided to take part in it. Where the project idea came from. And some more.</p>
<h2 id="3-2-1-…"><a href="#3-2-1-…" class="headerlink" title="3, 2, 1 …"></a>3, 2, 1 …</h2><p>… ready, get set, go! These words I have planned to write on March 1, when the main part of <a href="http://devstyle.pl/daj-sie-poznac/" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Get Noticed!</a> contest was about to start. Things didn’t went that well. I guessed I have fallen into the <em>hardest first step</em> hole. Publishing this post I hope I will <em>release the kraken</em> ;) and I will be more productive in this matter.</p>
<h2 id="Why"><a href="#Why" class="headerlink" title="Why?"></a>Why?</h2><p>Firstly I would like to point some reasons why I started this challenge. The whole February I was struggling in my head whether I should make such commitment, or I should not. I love reading blog posts, listening to podcasts and/or watching what others creativity is able to do. Many times I have read/heard how beneficial blogging can be. How it helped to develop those who started. How it changed their lives, and so on. At one point I also wanted those benefits, but on the other, I have got some other … priorities on which I could/should/want spend my time on.</p>
<p>What’s more, I was never into writing. One of the worst periods of my life was when I had to write my diploma thesis ;) I used to write a lot with people over the Internet, but I guess it’s slightly different. There is no questions I can reply. I have to think about the post structure, subheadings, subject consistency, and bunch of whatnots. It ain’t easy … at least for now :)</p>
<p>The decision about submitting the contest form has been made after a short talk of <a href="http://mycodesmells.com/" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Paweł Słomka</a> at <a href="http://2017.boilingfrogs.pl" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Boiling Frogs 2017</a> conference I attended. He talked about his challenge of 100 posts in a single year, and how that influenced himself. 100 posts a year is more less the same as the requirement of <em>Get Noticed!</em> rules, except, just for 10 weeks. Paweł has successfully completed his <em>daunting</em> commitment, so why shouldn’t I. At least I will try.</p>
<h2 id="What"><a href="#What" class="headerlink" title="What?"></a>What?</h2><p>Along with the <em>sign in or not</em> dilemma, I had to figure out what kind of a project I would like to develop. What kind of a problem I would like to solve with it? Who will use it? How will it work? Lot of unanswered questions. I could use websites like <a href="http://ideaswatch.com" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ideaswatch.com</a> or take one from <a href="https://github.com/tastejs/awesome-app-ideas" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">awesome-app-ideas @ github</a>, but I have decided for follow a different path.</p>
<p>I started asking: which one of my own problems I would like to solve? Is it my very own and unique, or some others as well? What group of people I am part of, that could have certain set of concerns? Or even, who could potential pay for a good solution? That’s how I came up with this idea for an app called <em>EMA</em>. It’s an abbreviation from <em>Eat Me Again</em> :)</p>
<p>Since quite a while one of my interests is nutrition. Among my colleagues I am known for being vegan, but I rather think about my diet as <em>plant-based</em>. Health is my highest priority so I struggle every day to eat as <em>green</em> and <em>unprocessed</em> food as I can. At the same time, I would like to provide my body with all essential nutrients. But it is not that easy in these fast-paced times, having ready-made meals at our fingertips. So I would like to gather information about what I ate. How often do I eat certain products. What should I focus on the next time I enter the kitchen. <em>EMA</em> could help me. Hopefully :)</p>
<p>Some might say that there are plenty of apps that could do something similar. Sure. Probably. But, my excessive demands cannot be satisfied just like that ;) Plus, I would like to implement my own and curated list of features. Nothing that could distract or annoy me each and every day. More details about the app itself I will present in future posts. I have to figure them out first :)</p>
<h2 id="For"><a href="#For" class="headerlink" title="For?"></a>For?</h2><p>In the name of self-improvement. Mostly. Developing that project I plan to widen my knowledge in mobile development. Widen? I should write: get into any mobile development, because I am a total <em>newbie</em> in this subject. I have never did anything for mobile devices. I don’t even own a smartphone ;)</p>
<p>The second reason related with this blog and self-improvement would be <em>English</em>. At certain point I had to decide which language I will use creating this blog. I am quite fluent in English when it comes to reading or listening, but I kinda suck in writing and speaking. The latter one for sure. Hopefully, after the contest, I will be still motivated to write posts and keep growing my writing skills.</p>
<p>Having said that, please, do not hesitate to leave a comment regarding anything that could help me to improve. It doesn’t matter if I did a grammar mistake, I have implemented something wrong, I could write a piece of code shorter/nicer/more <a href="http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/38945/what-is-wrong-with-the-word-performant" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">performant(??)</a>, whatever. Any feedback is welcome. I am eager for it … unless I cannot learn from it. So then, any <em>valuable</em> feed is welcome ;) Under this post as well as under future ones. Thanks in advance.</p>
<h2 id="Goals"><a href="#Goals" class="headerlink" title="Goals?"></a>Goals?</h2><p>Well, previous chapters point out reasons why I have started the <em>EMA</em> project. Self-improvement is my goal, but it could be hard to measure if I have already reached it or not. After reading one of <a href="http://www.javadevmatt.pl/projekt-do-daj-sie-poznac-cele-i-wstepny-plan/" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">JavaDevMatt’s blog posts</a>, I thought I could set something similar for my pet project too. One of his goals was to acknowledge more about making money on mobile games and earn 100 zloty making one. I have no clue how profitable are mobile games, nor nutrition apps, so I set the minimum income at th level of 1 zloty. Yeap, just one :) That should force me to focus on wider range of aspects of mobile development, not only the technology I will use, code I will wrote, etc. If this symbolic one zloty is impossible to gain, please, don’t tell me that ;)</p>
<p>And thanks for reading :)</p>
